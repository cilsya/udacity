    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The CNN-RNN architecture is used in combination to be an encoder-decoder architecture specifically to ingest and image as input and output a text caption as a result. For the past recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are best to feature extract information from images. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) works well on text. By taking an already trained CNN (which is usually how people use an already trained CNN and do transfer lerning instead of training one from scratch,)\n",
    "we can do transfer learning where we remove the fully connected layer from the CNN. The output is then flattened to a vector, before being passed through a Linear layer to transform the feature vector to have the same size as the word embedding and put as input to the RNN. This converts images to a text based output instead of possibly a categorical output like in a CNN network. Popular CNN to start of with and use transfer learning are LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet and more (you can view some description of them here https://medium.com/@sidereal/cnns-architectures-lenet-alexnet-vgg-googlenet-resnet-and-more-666091488df5). It is mentioned in the previous notebook that the encoder is trained on ResNet-50 architecture with the last fully connected layer removed. As stated in the lectures LSTM seem to work better in most cases over RNN, it addresses the vanishing gradient issue. I will be using LSTM here. As a note, it is hinted in the lectures that Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) gives comparable results to Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) and it seems to be more efficient. However, I believe LSTM is the standard approach at the moment but GRU networks seem to be getting more and more used. The one thing that I always find to be  challenging for building a network (assuming you have sufficient data) is the network architecture and hyperparemeter tuning. There are \n",
    "tips and guidelines to help such as keeping a network about 2 or 3 layers deep, making it deeper does not really help based on observations, except for CNN networks. To prevent overfitting, reduce the number of nodes in a layer or implement drop-out. If you pre-process the data and normalize prior, your learning rate alpha should be one of values of (0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001.) In general, the tip I get the most from mentors is, look for a paper that is similar in terms of input and output and use a similar architecture, inputs (i.e. similar pre-processing of data), and the hyperparameter values. In theory, your starting point should be in the ball park. I guess this makes sense since intuitively you are mapping the solution space from inputs to output in a similar fashion and tuning the values should traverse the solution space similar to a proven architecture described in a paper. Reading through the papers https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf, I chose to use a vocabulary count threshold of 5, embed size of 256 so all inputs are the same size for the architecture to solve, and hidden size of 512.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I left the transform as is. I am a believer of changing when necessary, or as in one of the AI lecturers mentioned, \"try the naive approach first, then add intelligence if needed.\" Not saying that the provided image transform is naive, it is assuming that it is fine and will work until proven otherwise. Assuming that it works at least reduces another variable to worry about, at least initially. If it works, great less work to do. If not, continue to dig deeper until you get the root of the problem. I think the provided image transform gave good result. Neural networks require the same input size, so having RandomCrop with value of 224 ensures that. Another technique in pre-processing data is data augmentation. Having RandomHorizontalFlip with value of 0.5 augments the dataset without explicitly acquiring more images. As mentioned in the answer of question 1, normalizing the data and using the same standard deviation as the CNN it is based on makes it more comparable likely to be in the ball park of the solution space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The example given is exactly how transfer learning usually done. We are using a pre-trained model for the encoder, so we don't want to make the parameters in the network trainable (i.e. we would like to freeze them) except for the embedded layer. For the decoder, we are training it from scratch so we would like to make all of the parameters trainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** As a rule of thumb, I default to Adam. Since I learned about Adam, it was advise to default to it and use the default to the values from the original paper. These papers, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf, used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using adaptive learning rate algorithms."

    "### A Note on Tuning Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "To figure out how well your model is doing, you can look at how the training loss and perplexity evolve during training - and for the purposes of this project, you are encouraged to amend the hyperparameters based on this information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this will not tell you if your model is overfitting to the training data, and, unfortunately, overfitting is a problem that is commonly encountered when training image captioning models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you need not worry about overfitting. **This project does not have strict requirements regarding the performance of your model**, and you just need to demonstrate that your model has learned **_something_** when you generate captions on the test data.  For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you would like to go above and beyond in this project, you can read about some approaches to minimizing overfitting in section 4.3.1 of [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636).  In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
