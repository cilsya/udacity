### 1. Sudoku Solver
In this project, you will extend the Sudoku-solving agent developed in the classroom lectures to solve diagonal Sudoku puzzles and implement a new constraint strategy called "naked twins". A diagonal Sudoku puzzle is identical to traditional Sudoku puzzles with the added constraint that the boxes on the two main diagonals of the board must also contain the digits 1-9 in each cell (just like the rows, columns, and 3x3 blocks).
