# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program Resources

### 2. Classical Planning
This project is split between implementation and analysis. First you will combine symbolic logic and classical search to implement an agent that performs progression search to solve planning problems. Then you will experiment with different search algorithms and heuristics, and use the results to answer questions about designing planning systems.

**Please read report.pdf for final results.**
